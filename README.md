# Adaptive Weighted Rejection Sampling

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2504.05410-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05410)

This repository contains content related to the paper *Fast Controlled Generation from Language Models with Adaptive Weighted Rejection Sampling* (COLM 2025).

The most performant reference implementation of the AWRS-SMC algorithm can be found in the actively maintained [genlm/genlm-control](https://github.com/genlm/genlm-control) library.

Tidied scripts to replicate the paper experiments based on the [genlm/genlm-control](https://github.com/genlm/genlm-control) and [genlm/genlm-eval](https://github.com/genlm/genlm-eval) libraries will be available shortly.
